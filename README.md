# Lucky-Wiki (Firefox Addon)

This extension enhances your browsing experience by detecting search queries that contain the standalone word "wiki" and automatically redirecting through a "Feeling Lucky" search function.

For example:
- "tree wiki" → directly opens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree
- "intel arch wiki" → directly opens https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics
- "python list wiki" → directly opens the most relevant Python list documentation

Features:
- Ultimately goes through DuckDuckGo's bang syntax for final redirect
- Automatically bypasses redirect notices
- Zero configuration required
- Lightweight with minimal permissions

Note: This extension only activates when "wiki" appears as a standalone word in your search. "treewiki" or "tree-wiki" will not work.
