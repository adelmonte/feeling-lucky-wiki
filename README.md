# Feeling-Lucky-Wiki (Firefox Addon)

This Firefox addon redirects search queries in the URL bar through Google's 'I'm Feeling Lucky" function only if the phrase contains the stand-alone word "wiki".

For instance:
"tree wiki" will redirect to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree and "intel arch wiki" will redirect to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics

The addon skips all Google Redirect Notices automatically.

***NOTE***
This addon is **NOT** compatable with **ClearURLs** addon.
