# Feeling-Lucky-Wiki (Firefox Addon)

If you're anything like me, you've been using search engines to get to the first link for years. I cannot be bothered to type out @wikipedia or remember any other shortcuts. I just search something like "example wiki" and click the first link 99% of the time.

This Firefox addon redirects search queries in the URL bar through Google's 'I'm Feeling Lucky" function if the phrase contains the stand-alone word "wiki".

For instance:
"tree wiki" will redirect to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree 
"intel arch wiki" will redirect to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics

***NOTE***
This addon is **NOT** compatable with **ClearURLs** addon.


I don't like Google, but it's the fastest for this purpose.
